[Measure Description:]{.underline}

-   Define the Actual Measure

    -   Dental care availability based on 2-step floating enhanced floating catchment areas

-   Purpose of the Measure

    -   This measure is an accumulation of dentists per population rations weighted by distance or travel time in each catchment area (area within which a provider is accessible). Weights are defined by the demand for dentists (population served by dentists). Provider address data was collected from WebMD's online Physician Directory.
